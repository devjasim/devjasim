### 🧠 About Me

I’m a **Senior Frontend Engineer** with 5+ years of experience designing and building high-performance web platforms.  
I specialize in **React, Next.js, TypeScript, and Node.js**, with a strong focus on scalability, accessibility, and user experience.

Currently, I’m leading the frontend architecture of a **healthcare management platform** built with a micro-frontend monorepo setup — powering modules for nursing, medication, pharmacy, and HR workflows.

I love turning complex product ideas into elegant, performant solutions — while mentoring teams, improving processes, and continuously learning new technologies.
